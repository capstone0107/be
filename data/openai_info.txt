OpenAI API: Powerful AI Models

OpenAI provides access to powerful AI models through their API. The API allows developers to integrate advanced AI capabilities into their applications.

Available Models:

GPT-4:
- Most capable model
- Better at complex tasks
- More expensive
- Supports up to 8K or 32K tokens

GPT-3.5-Turbo:
- Fast and efficient
- Good for most tasks
- Cost-effective
- Supports up to 4K or 16K tokens

Embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002):
- Convert text to numerical vectors
- Used for semantic search
- Clustering and recommendations
- 1536 dimensions

Key Concepts:

Tokens:
Tokens are pieces of words. As a rough rule of thumb:
- 1 token ~= 4 characters in English
- 1 token ~= 3/4 words
- 100 tokens ~= 75 words

Temperature:
Controls randomness in responses (0-2):
- 0: Deterministic, focused
- 1: Balanced (default)
- 2: Very creative, random

API Usage:

Chat Completions:
Used for conversational AI. Send a list of messages with roles:
- system: Sets behavior of assistant
- user: User messages
- assistant: AI responses

Example:
{
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is FastAPI?"}
  ]
}

Embeddings:
Create vector representations of text for semantic search:
- Input: Text string or array of strings
- Output: Array of floats (embedding vector)

Best Practices:
- Use system messages to set context and behavior
- Keep prompts clear and specific
- Use temperature wisely based on use case
- Implement retry logic for API calls
- Monitor token usage for cost management
- Cache responses when possible
- Use streaming for long responses
- Implement rate limiting

Security:
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use environment variables for keys
- Implement proper authentication
- Monitor API usage
- Set spending limits in OpenAI dashboard

Pricing Considerations:
- Different models have different costs
- Charged based on tokens (input + output)
- Embeddings are cheaper than completions
- GPT-4 is more expensive than GPT-3.5
- Use caching and optimization to reduce costs
