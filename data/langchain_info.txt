LangChain: Building Applications with LLMs

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
- Context-aware: connect a language model to sources of context
- Reasoning: rely on a language model to reason about how to answer based on provided context

Components:
1. LLM Wrappers: Unified interface for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc.)
2. Prompt Templates: Reusable templates for prompts
3. Chains: Combine multiple LLM calls and actions
4. Agents: Let LLMs make decisions about which actions to take
5. Memory: Persist state between chain/agent calls
6. Indexes: Ways to structure documents for LLM interaction

Key Concepts:

Chains:
Chains are the core of LangChain. They combine multiple components together. For example, a simple chain might:
- Take user input
- Format it with a prompt template
- Pass it to an LLM
- Parse the output

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
RAG is a technique where you augment the LLM's knowledge with external data. The process:
1. Load documents
2. Split documents into chunks
3. Create embeddings for chunks
4. Store embeddings in a vector database
5. When querying, retrieve relevant chunks
6. Pass chunks to LLM as context

Vector Stores:
LangChain supports various vector stores:
- Chroma
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- FAISS
- And many more

Document Loaders:
LangChain provides loaders for various document types:
- Text files
- PDFs
- Web pages
- Databases
- APIs

Example RAG Implementation:
1. Load documents: DirectoryLoader or TextLoader
2. Split text: RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
3. Create embeddings: OpenAIEmbeddings
4. Store in vector DB: Chroma
5. Create retriever: vectorstore.as_retriever()
6. Build QA chain: RetrievalQA.from_chain_type()

Best Practices:
- Choose appropriate chunk sizes (typically 500-1500 characters)
- Use overlap between chunks (typically 10-20% of chunk size)
- Select the right embedding model for your use case
- Optimize retrieval parameters (number of documents to retrieve)
- Consider hybrid search approaches
