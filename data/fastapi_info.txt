FastAPI: Modern Web Framework for Python

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key Features:
- Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic)
- Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%
- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors
- Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs
- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration
- Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation
- Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema

FastAPI uses:
- Starlette for the web parts
- Pydantic for the data parts

Installation:
You can install FastAPI using pip:
pip install fastapi

You also need an ASGI server for production such as Uvicorn:
pip install uvicorn[standard]

Basic Example:
Create a file main.py with:

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

Run the server with:
uvicorn main:app --reload

The --reload flag makes the server restart after code changes.

Interactive API Documentation:
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI at /docs and ReDoc at /redoc.
